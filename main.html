<h2>Mission Statment</h2>
<p>
You may not realise it, but by cutting the grass in our gardens and on our greens we reduce the number of wild flowers and plants which bees need to collect pollen in order to survive, make honey and to pollinate other plants. Although bees and other insects can be seen as pests the reality is that the loss of our bees will mean a reduction in the quality and quantity of our locally produced fruit and veg. This will also lead to the price of these goods rising.
Two of the native Irish bees have already become extinct but there are simple steps which you can take which will help to save the bees and other pollinators in Ireland.

In order to raise the awareness MTU decided to form a society named as “Save the bees”; and you are bring in the IT expertise to that society. The Save the bees group in MTU want to create a web page to promote events planned for the region.  Not all future events are known at this time so they want to have it developed in stages.
